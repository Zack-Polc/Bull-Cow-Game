# Bull-Cow-Game
A console based word guessing game made in c++



The program thinks of any isogram word (However in this case its hard coded to be: "plane") because im still learning.

The player try to figure that word by guessing isogram words containing the same number of letters.

Program responds with the number of Cows & Bulls for each guessed word. As with the digit version, "Cow" means a letter in the wrong position, while "Bull" means a letter in the right position.
